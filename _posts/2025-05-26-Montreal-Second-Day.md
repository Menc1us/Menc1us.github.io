<h1>The Morning of the Second Day</h1>

I awoke early on my second day, though, having lacked sleep the night before for fear of the dangers of air travel, I would say that my sleep was inadequate. From the dorm, I embarked on the journey to the DHSI building along with the rest of the team. We partook in the coffee and pastries granted to us by the DHSI administrators, and attended a lecture by Dr. Ichiro Fujinaga of McGill University.

<h2>Dr. Fujinaga</h2>

Dr. Fujinaga's work is predominantly focused on digitally archiving music notation. I foud his SIMSSA initiative, particularly with regard to his documenting of medieval chants and hymns to be really interesting. During his lecture, he described the pedagogy or "mechagogy," as he calls it, associated with teaching computer programs to scan through music notation. His lecture focused on what he calls a lazy sort of pedagogy, in which we, as humanists, engage with computer in the most efficient way whilst applying the least amount of work. His work with Optical Music Recognition embodies that pedagogy in its totality.
I was particularly interested in the application of the Nearest Neighbor Classifier, which I'll admit I don't understand fully. Indeed, the closest I came to understanding it was in an example Dr. Fujinaga gave regarding Sumo wrestlers and basketball players. We, as humans, can understand difference because we know the contexts of the sport. But a computer needs to be taught based on visual differences, as if it were an alien. So, we give the computer an array of sumo wrestlers and basketball players and have the computer sort them by size and height on a graph. The computer may therefore be able to understand what kind of sport they play by comparing to the nearest neighbor, from where the classifier gets its name.
This sort of process is equally true in OMR, where we teach a computer to read music notation and separate the staff, notes, and other fluff present in manuscripts based on one sample size given. While the process is imperfect, it certainly has shown to be the most consistent pedagogy for online archiving.

<h2>Restarting JavaScript</h2>
I had taken JavaScript before this class, but I have had little to no application of the language, and as such, most of it had left my head by the first day of class. We went over the basic concepts of the syntax, including const and let variables as well as an early introduction to loops. I was excited to learn a computer language with a group of humanists. Everyone was so eager to ask questions, and we ended up going off on long tangents simply trying to understand how things functioned and what their applicaitons were. You could tell you in a room full of humanities coded students because our questions were almost always having to do with how something can be applied to our scholarship. I felt a bit out of place though, being the only undergraduate student in the room. Everyone else had clear goals for what they wanted to do with their JavaScript knowledge, meanwhile I was kind of just there for education's sake.
