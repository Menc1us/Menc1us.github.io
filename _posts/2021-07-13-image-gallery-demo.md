Forever Jekyll has built in Lightbox support so visitors-readers of your blog will find it very easy and convenient to view images posted by you.  
To add images to your posts all you need to do is replace <code>image_title</code> with your image title and <code>image_link</code> with the link to your image in the following snippet.  

```text
[![image_title](image_link)](image_link){:.glightbox}
```

Clicking on an image will open it in lightbox and you will be able to view it in full-screen as well as cycle through the rest of the images just like you would in any other image viewer.
